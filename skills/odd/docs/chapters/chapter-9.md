# Chapter 9: Start from Zero

`npx odd-studio init` sets up everything: the /odd skill, six safety hooks, project scaffold, and ruflo persistent memory. Ruflo stores all project state between sessions so you never have to reconstruct context from scratch.

This chapter is about the practical starting point. You have your outcomes, your contract map, and your phase plan. Now you set up the environment that will carry you through the build. One command does it. Everything after that command is building and verifying.

## Key Principles

- **Ruflo preserves the project state between sessions so you never have to reconstruct it.** Every outcome, every contract, every verification result, every decision recorded in CLAUDE.md — ruflo keeps it all. When you start a new session, ODD Studio reads from ruflo and picks up exactly where you left off. You do not re-explain your project.

- **The six safety hooks protect the build.** They run automatically: pre-commit checks, contract validation, verification gating. You do not manage them. They prevent the kinds of errors that silently corrupt a project — committing unverified outcomes, breaking existing contracts, skipping steps.

- **Git is non-negotiable.** Every verified outcome is committed. Every commit is a checkpoint you can return to. Without git, a failed build can destroy working code. With git, it cannot. ODD Studio handles the commits — you just verify and confirm.

- **The scaffold is a starting structure, not a constraint.** `odd-studio init` creates the directories and files your project needs. It reflects the methodology's structure — outcomes, contracts, phases. As your project grows, the structure grows with it.

## Red Flags

- Skipping git. Without version control, there is no safety net. A failed build overwrites working code with no way back. ODD Studio commits after every verified outcome specifically to prevent this. Do not bypass it.

- Attempting to manage project state manually. If you are keeping notes in a separate document, copying context into prompts, or re-explaining your project at the start of each session, you are doing ruflo's job by hand. Let the tool manage state.

- Modifying safety hooks without understanding them. The six hooks exist for specific reasons. If a hook blocks something, it is usually catching a real problem. Understand why before overriding.

- Starting a build before init. If you begin building without running init, you have no hooks, no ruflo memory, no project scaffold. You are building without a safety net or a state manager.

## What This Means for You

If you have not already, run `npx odd-studio init` in your project directory. Confirm that git is initialised, the skill is loaded, and ruflo is connected. Then move to your Phase A outcomes.

The setup is a one-time step. Everything after this is the repeating rhythm of build, verify, confirm — which Chapter 10 covers next.

Next: Chapter 10 introduces the Build Protocol — the session rhythm that carries you through every outcome.
